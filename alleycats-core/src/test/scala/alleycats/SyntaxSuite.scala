/**
 * Test that our syntax implicits are working.
 *
 * Each method should correspond to one type class worth of syntax.
 * Ideally, we should be testing every operator or method that we
 * expect to add to generic parameters. This file is a safeguard
 * against accidentally breaking (or removing) syntax which was
 * otherwise untested.
 *
 * The strategy here is to create "mock" values of particular types,
 * and then ensure that the syntax we want is available. We never plan
 * to run any of these methods, so we don't need real values. All
 * values in the methods should be generic -- we rely on parametricity
 * to guarantee that the syntax will be available for any type with
 * the proper type class instance(s).
 *
 * None of these tests should ever run, or do any runtime checks.
